# ⚡ LightniNG ⚡

**LightniNG is a free browser-based (eventually desktop) weather app that actually alerts you of the weather!**

Weather decides many of our decisions, from what we spend, to what we do with our time, to where we want to go for business or leisure.

There used to be all sorts of apps with recognized name recognition based on their brand that could alert you as to what the weather was like in your area and if there were storms in the vicinity. Now, just about every weather app just sits on your computer, sometimes not even for where you are. Almost none of them alert you of the local weather. And some times (in the case of Microsoft's Live tiles) not even updating the information. What good is a weather app that doesn't tell you the current weather?

LightniNG is a new app that notifies you of weather alerts in the area as they occur and can tell you what is going on in your area, using various sources.

Users have control over what information they would like to see. Unlike other free weather apps that spend most of their time collecting user data for advertising but never giving them the vital information which was the reason they downloaded the app in the first place, Lightning gives user the power to opt out of marketing features (if those are ever implemented). The user doesn't have to tell the app anything about where they are or what their computer is doing, they can simply get the weather, most of the data provided by the National Weather Service.

*Use a weather app that give you power! ⚡ Use LightniNG!*

## Features

* **Show forecasts for your area.** This is a given. It wouldn't be a weather app if it didn't at least tell you this information.
* **Get weather alerts in your browser based on location.** Enable Geolocation for hyperlocal information.
* **Save places you want forecasts and notifications.** Finally a good use for the Notifications API that won't spam you with breaking news about human interest stories.
* **Set what type of notifications you would like for specific areas.** Think of it as a weather radio for your desktop. The goal is to use the same [S.A.M.E.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_Area_Message_Encoding) messages that are posted 
* See local radar images provided by the National Weather Service.
* **Secure!** Unlike the big boys that scrape usage for advertising, you have the control to opt out of that
